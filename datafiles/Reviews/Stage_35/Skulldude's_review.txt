A charming sudoku-esque stage, mainly based on the hit game I Wanna be the Hamster and mixing it with some good old-fashioned V-Kid.

This amount of stupidity is its selling point and where it shines, it's hilarious.

It definitely doesn't do the original Hamster enough justice, but I'd say it's pretty hard to get to that point.

The celebrity cameos spice the stage up a bit for a nice change of pace, see if you too can spot them!

Very silly stage, if you're not into turning your brain off for a hot minute, chances are you'll probably hate it.
